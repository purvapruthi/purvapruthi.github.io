## About Me

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) department at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), advised by [David Jensen](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/jensen/). My research combines causality, compositional reasoning and modular deep learning to develop efficient and scalable causal models for complex real-world systems such as databases, software programs, and manufacuring assembly system. I am also interested in out-of-distribution generalization, and understanding theoretical characteristics of modular models as compared to non-modular models in machine learning. 

I am also a part-time consultant at [Offline Studio](https://www.offlinestudio.com/), where I help early-stage startups building innovative AI products. Previously, I was an AI resident at [Google X, The Moonshot Factory](https://x.company/), working on causal inference applications in agriculture and biology. I also interned at Amazon Cambridge (Summer 2018), working with [Javier Gonzalez](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jagonz/) and [Xiaoyu Lu](https://xiaoyulu2014.github.io/) on developing a transfer-learning framework for reinforcement learning. Previously, I also worked with [Madalina Fiterau](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfiterau/) at the intersection of causal reasoning and healthcare. Before my Ph.D., I spent three years at Goldman Sachs building statistical models for systematic trading and trade settlement analysis.


I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in/) in 2015, where I worked with [Durga Toshniwal](http://www.durgatoshniwal.in/) on spatio-temporal diffusion analysis of online information on Twitter. I also enjoyed doing competitive programming as part of [Programming and Algorithms group (PAG)](https://pag.iitr.ac.in/) in college.
Outside work, I enjoy writing prose poetry, reading books, playing piano, and doing yoga!
