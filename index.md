## About Me

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) department at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), advised by [David Jensen](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/jensen/). My research combines causality, compositional reasoning, and modular deep learning to develop efficient and scalable models for complex real-world systems such as databases, software programs, and manufacturing assembly systems. My research also focuses on understanding the out-of-distribution generalization characteristics of modern machine learning models, such as transformers. 

Previously, I had the opportunity to intern with the Energy & Materials Division at Toyota Research Institute, applying causal models for applications in fuel cell and battery design. I spent nine months as an AI resident at [Google X, The Moonshot Factory](https://x.company/), where I worked on causal inference applications in agriculture and biology. I also interned at Amazon Cambridge (Summer 2018), working with [Javier Gonzalez](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jagonz/) and [Xiaoyu Lu](https://xiaoyulu2014.github.io/) on developing a transfer-learning framework for reinforcement learning. Before my Ph.D., I spent three years at Goldman Sachs building statistical models for sell-side recommendations and trade settlement analysis. Outside of work, I enjoy writing prose poetry, reading popular science, science fiction books, playing piano, and practicing yoga.
